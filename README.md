# xfwm4-minimal-setup
xfwm4-minimal-setup, just xfwm4, sxhkd for shortcut, dmenu for launcher
How to use it :
1. place the configs to their place (sxhkdrc to ~/.config/sxhkd)
2. launch xfwm4 with command "xinit /path/to/.xinitrc-xfwm4 -- /etc/X11/xinit/xserverrc :0 vt1 -keeptty"
3. You may also copy the .xinitrc-xfwm4 into .xinitrc and then launch it with "startx"
4. don't forget to install xfwm4, sxhkd, dmenu, xterm!

Thanks
